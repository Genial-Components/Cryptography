## Getting Started
Cryptography component for Genial Framework.

### Prerequisites

> It is recommended that you use the latest version of PHP <br />

> It is also recommended that if you use PHP 5.6 that you use the latest <br />
> version for 5.6. The same goes with PHP 7.0, PHP 7.1, and PHP 7.2. 

- PHP `^5.6|^7.0`
- [Mbstring](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) Extension
- [OpenSSL](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) Extension

### Installation

> Composer should be used as your main dependency manager.

Composer makes it easier to keep vendor libraries out of your repo, meaning that only application <br />code goes in the git repository. It literally does all the work for you so maintaining the latest versions of all required libraries is <br />easier because you can simply run `composer update` to get the latest compatible packages.

You can use the installer by going to their [website](https://getcomposer.org/) and clicking download and it will show all the installation instructions. Once it has been installed correctly you proceed with running the console command below.

```sh
composer require genial-framework/cryptography
```
