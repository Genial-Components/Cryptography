- PHP > 7.2.0
- [OpenSSL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) Extension

## Installation

### Install Composer
> Composer should be used as your main dependency manager.

Composer makes it easier to keep vendor libraries out of your repo, meaning that only application code goes in the git repository. It also makes maintaining the latest versions of all required libraries easier because you can simply run `composer update` to get the latest compatible packages.

You can use the installer by going to their [website](https://getcomposer.org/) and clicking download and it will show all the installation instructions. Once it has been installed correctly you proceed with running the console command below.

```sh
composer require genial-framework/cryptography
```
